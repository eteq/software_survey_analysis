Astronomical software engineer,In my experience on three large telescope projects the technologies chosen (languages libraries tools etc) have been very old fashioned (e.g. C Perl ds9 etc). We are now only just catching up with tools I used in industry more than ten years ago. I believe this to be a major cause of major inefficiently in astronomical software development.

Postdoc,"Not really sure what counts as ""a lot"" of software development training. Took 1.5 years of CS courses at the start of my undergraduate degree along with a lot of exposure to implementing numerical methods in applied maths. But little to no training since undergrad; all self-taught (notably in Fortran which I now use regularly)."
Graduate student,
Faculty,I'm intending to try out Python soon.
Postdoc,
unemployed postdoc,Funding agencies regularly justify PhD student training on the basis that graduates are capable programmers. I therefore find it ridiculous that PhD students receive no actual training in programming whatsoever and are expected to learn by osmosis and/or fixing up some ancient Fortran code.

Faculty,"At this stage of my career most of the serious coding is done by my graduate students or postdocs.  I was at the cutting edge of the field long ago but my knowledge and skill s haven't kept up.  At some level that doesn't matter so much provided I have capable collaborators.  However it would certainly be useful to have good ideas on practice and high-performance computing techniques so that I can advise my students better.  The general point here is that needs of senior faculty are rather different from those of junior researchers.  The other obvious point relevant to everyone is that it's hard to carve out time for learning about software practices in the abstract which is why we all tend to do what we can to ""teach ourselves on the fly"" with whatever resources we can come up with.  The time-cost to benefit ratio is different for researchers at different career stages."

Graduate student,I think it should be strongly recommended that people going into Astronomy should take programming classes. In fact I would make it part of the required course work to get a B.S. in Physics or Astronomy.Most astronomers I know did not take any formal programming course we learned as we went along. Most of us write our own code and many do not use good coding practices making reading or adapting code from other Astronomers a lot more painful than it should be.
Postdoc,Many astronomers (including myself) use ancient codes and data reduction software (IRAF MIDAS IDL) that are not easily portable to 21st century computer platforms. National observatories and funding agencies need to invest either in maintenance of these ancient codes or in redevelopment of common data reduction and analysis software. I consider this a severe bottleneck in the productivity of the astronomical community at large.

Postdoc,I learned IDL as an undergrad (class of 2004) and used it nearly exclusively for data reduction plotting and analysis until about two years ago. Over the last two years I've been slowly switching to Python for most plotting and analysis and some data reduction; some of my data reduction software is entrenched enough in IDL that it's unlikely I'll leave IDL behind entirely as long as I use data from that telescope.

Too many good researchers who contribute lots of great software to the community have been forced out of the field because of lack of recognition for their work and lack of funding for people other than those who publish several science papers a year.

Also when we write science proposals (e.g. NASA NSF) we have to lie about how much time we will spend developing code say only a few months when in reality it occupies most of the grant period since code development is frowned upon (except within the new NASA ROSES program PDART started in 2014).

And where does one put daomatch/daomaster?  The instructions for that are just opaque to my mind so I wrote my own and then use awk to correct the instrumental magnitudes from allstar to 1 second equivalents and apply the transformations from the standards."

Faculty,"In my view there are two aspects to programming:1. Learning about what programming is (or isnÕt) such as variables control structures and other fundamentals that occur in any language.  This includes learning how to solve a problem on paper (algorithms flowcharts psuedocodes) before you even sit in front of a computer.2. Learning about a specific language.  This is where you learn the specific ÒsyntaxÓ of a programming language Ð such as how to define variables build loops create functions etc.Astronomers might be better programmers if they had more of an understanding of what programming was before diving in and trying to make sense of a particular language (or for many PhD students their supervisor's existing codes and scripts).  The fundamentals of programming teach astronomers to be better problem solvers (in general) because programming is about looking at problems and breaking them down into (sequential or parallel) steps.  There is always a risk of going with a programming language that is the ""flavour of the month"" - a strong foundation in the fundamentals of programming offers some protection against that.Complementary to programming skills are the skills relating to software development (specifying requirements software design testing debugging strategies code management documentation etc.)."

Perhaps more than is the case for mathematics though the paper metric used for hiring scientists often pushes excellent software developers out of science and into industry who are then lost to us.

Graduate student,The coding skills incoming graduate students possess seem to vary wildly but they are often dismal with respect to the level required to begin doing serious research right away. In my department there seems to be little motivation to rectify this with either: (1) requiring undergraduate CS preparation as a condition for admission; or (2) organizing a programming course for beginning graduate students. This situation seems if not unsustainable very much non-optimal for the cultivation of strong substantive independent research skills. I imagine many other departments are currently facing the same dilemma.

Research scientist,Question 4 is a little tricky - I work on some large collaborative projects such as Gaia DPAC - writing lots of software but also using lots of other peoples (either who are jointly developing) or as a 3rd party bit of code.

Faculty,"As I get older I cannot keep up with the rapid changes in software. It is not just my age - software changes so quickly now. However there is a good side to this too. The software has become more object oriented which allows us to stitch together packages and libraries. You can program in python but call C or Fortran IRAF and whatever other languages you need.Astronomers waste too much time arguing what is the ""best"" software. The best is whatever you use to get your stuff done."

Graduate student,I learned IDL as an undergrad and continue to mostly code in it as a grad student. However I've been learning Python lately and plan to mostly switch over within the next year or so.

Emeritus Faculty,After years of Fortran going back to the early 60's then complementedby Mongo for graphics  I saw the light and now do everything in IDL.  Iswore that I would not learn another language but the handwriting ison the wall that I will have to learn Python.  Why?  Because it seemsto be free.
